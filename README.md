# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

> Analyze the performance of several different Kickstarter campaigns to see how they fared based on launch date and goal

### Purpose

> To see how the different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to each other so we can better choose kickstarter campaigns in the future

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

> Based on the graph 'Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date' Kickstarter campaigns launched in the month of may saw the most success while in december the amount of succesful and failed kickstarter campaigns was the same.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

> It is hard to find a pattern here, the amount of outcomes that were succesful or failed varied in relation to each other, the more failures the less successes and viceversa, with outliers in the success 'Greater than  50000' space.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

> The most difficult part in this for me was getting the =COUNTIF() functions to populate correctly, was a very manual process

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

> May saw the highest rate of succesful kickstarter campaigns while December saw the least succesful amount of campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

> That success and failures seem to move in opposite directions in relation with one another	

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

> There appears to be outliers in the data

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

> could make a graph to show success rate based on 'country'
